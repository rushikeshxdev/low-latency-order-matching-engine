# ðŸš€ Low-Latency Order Matching Engine

**Overview:**
This project implements a **C++ low-latency matching engine** simulating a limit order book, designed to process and match buy/sell orders in **sub-millisecond latency**.

**Objectives:**
- Process high volumes of incoming orders in real time.
- Maintain price-time priority.
- Benchmark performance to handle **100,000+ orders per second**.

**Roadmap:**
- âœ… Design core data structures.
- â¬œ Implement order insertion and cancellation.
- â¬œ Develop matching logic.
- â¬œ Write unit tests.
- â¬œ Benchmark throughput and latency.
- â¬œ Optimize memory usage.

**Technologies:**
- C++17
- STL Maps and Queues

**Getting Started:**
Code implementation coming soon.
